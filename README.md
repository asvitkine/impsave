# ImpSave 0.24

ImpSave is a helpful companion for the Imperialism PC game.

It has two primary functions:
  1. Automatically backing up saved games, allowing to restore to an earlier turn.
  2. Patching the Imperialism.exe binary (GOG version) to fix a few crash bugs.

To use it, simply place the ImpSave.jar inside your Imperialism folder and run it.
You'll need to have Java installed.

The program will bring up a window that lets you start Imperialism and apply patches
to it (if it's a known version of the binary, such as the GOG release).

While the program is running, it will automatically monitor the `Save` folder for
new and updated saved games and make back ups. A restore tab lets you restore any
saved game and annotate saves with additional comments.
